    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was using <a href="https://github.com/staugaard/resque-multi-job-forks/">resque-multi-job-forks</a>
plugin for quite a some time. What was bugging me is that the project seemed to be abandoned.
There were no new commits for 2 years. And current version of the gem had dependency on an
archaic version of Resque. So, I forked, bumped the dependency and bundled the gem. But
then I thought: "Hey, why not share it with people?" I exchanged a couple of emails with
the owner and now I am the official owner/maintainer of said gem. This is my first
takeover, hooray! :)</p>

<p>To celebrate this, today I have released version v0.3.2, which includes updated <code>resque</code>
dependency and fix for the problem when workers disappeared from resque-web after the first
fork has reached its limit.</p>

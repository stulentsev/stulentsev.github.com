    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I decided to give TextMate 2 another try today. Hopefully it won't freeze upon trying to install a bundle like it did last time. Now I don't recall which bundle was that, but so far things are going well. Mostly.</p>

<p>When I opened my Rails app and tried to navigate to file (<code>Cmd+T</code>), I saw this:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/uploads/2013/10/30/tm2_tmp_files.png"></p>

<p>At first I thought that these are files from <code>.git</code> folder and spent embarrassing amount of time trying to make TM2 hide that folder. But these are actually temp asset files generated by Sprockets and they reside in <code>tmp/assets/...</code>.</p>

<p>Long story short, here's how you can hide a directory in TextMate 2, both from project browser and navigation dialog.</p>

<p>Create a <code>.tm_properties</code> file. It can be in current project dir or any parent dir (up to <code>$HOME</code>). Put this line into it.</p>

<p><code>
excludeDirectories = "{tmp,}"
</code></p>

<p>It is worth noting that <code>"{tmp}"</code> doesn't work. Apparently, TextMate glob parser breaks down if it can't find a comma. So we add one. Alternatively we can use this line:</p>

<p><code>
excludeDirectories = "{$excludeDirectories,tmp}"
</code></p>

<p>It will amend an existing <code>excludeDirectories</code> setting (empty string by default) instead of replacing. And it also has a comma. :)</p>

<p>Hope this post saved you some time.</p>

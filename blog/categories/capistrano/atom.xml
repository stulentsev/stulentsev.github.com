    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I want to share with you a small tweak I came up with a couple of days ago. As some of you
know, Mac OS X includes a ton of very handy utilities. One of them is <code>say</code>. The name is
pretty descriptive, you pass it a string and it voices it, using text-to-speech engine,
that is built in Mac OS. Try it now:</p>

<p><code>bash
$ say Hello world!
</code></p>

<p>You can use it anywhere where you can invoke shell commands. Here's my capistrano
after-hook, for example:</p>

<p><code>ruby
after 'deploy' do
  `say Sire, our unicorns have been deployed`
  # note the backticks. This string is roughly equivalent to
  # system "say Sire, our unicorns have been deployed"
end
</code></p>

<p>Now I can launch my <code>cap deploy</code> (which can take minute or two) and go read Hacker News or
whatever. I will be told when deploy is finished. I'm using this for a few days already
and it still make me smile everytime. I should probably come up with more creative messages.</p>

<p>Happy tweaking!</p>

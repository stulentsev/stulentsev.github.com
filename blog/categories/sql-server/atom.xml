    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I had to fight one small, but highly annoying problem. It is related to Entity Framework and SQL Server connection string. When you create a .edmx file with your model, the wizard automatically inserts proper connection string to your app.config or web.config file. Well, it is not always correct string.</p>

<p>In my case, I have .edmx file in a class library and it worked fine when I was using it from WinForms application. But then I decided to put it on a web site. And it ceased to work. The only thing I could get from it was</p>

<p>SQL Server 2005 SQLExpress error: ...provider: Named Pipes Provider, error 40 - Could not open connection to SQL Server</p>

<p>I tried many things, but in the end it turned to be some mistreatment of a connection string. Mine looks this way:</p>

<p><a href="http://software.tulentsev.com/images/uploads/2008/12/image1.png"><img src="http://software.tulentsev.com/images/uploads/2008/12/image-thumb1.png" alt="image" /></a></p>

<p>The problem goes away when I put a backslash instead of slash in "./SQLEXPRESS". It looks pretty weird, because they always used forward slash in such autogenerated connection strings, didn't they?</p>

<p>P.S.: Sorry about connection string being image here. :-)</p>

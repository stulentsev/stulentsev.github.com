  <div class="entry-content"><p>One thing I dislike in my current Vista installation is how it behaves while trying to unmount USB harddrive. I have a 320 gig external drive, which serves as a storage for my backups, torrents and videos. Also I store and run different virtual machines from it.</p>

<p>This morning I was about to go to the office. I shut down <a href="http://www.utorrent.com/">uTorrent</a> and clicked &#8220;Safely remove&#8221; on my drive. &#8220;This disk cannot be removed right now. I don&#8217;t know who uses it, but someone surely is.&#8221; was the response. I tried again. The same result. Hmm, maybe some program or explorer window is indeed hanging around. I double-checked all icons on a taskbar, then running processes in Task Manager. Nothing.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong with you?&#8221;, I said to the laptop and tried once again. &#8220;Now you can safely remove the hardware&#8221;. Oh, thank you so much! Why couldn&#8217;t you do it the first time I asked you? (And this happens to me on a regular basis, daily. Sometimes, two or three times a day).</p>

<p>As a tech guy I can guess what&#8217;s happening. uTorrent opens a lot of files and it probably takes some time to close them and flush all buffers to the drive (which is not very fast, it is external tiny box). Ok, no problem with that. But couldn&#8217;t it be done synchronously? I think, Windows can easily recognize situations when some program has open file handles on the drive, or just some file buffers need to be flushed. In the latter case it could show a popup &#8220;Removing the drive, please wait&#8230;&#8221; and do its work. That would leave no space for speculations.</p>

<p>In the other case (when a program uses a disk): is it too difficult to point at the culprit? Some installers can do this. And I am pretty sure there is a 3rd party software that does this. This is pure usability issue. I hope they&#8217;ll take care of it in Windows 7.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h3>Problems with formatting</h3>

<p>The &#8220;official&#8221; way to format strings in .NET BCL is to use <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.string.format.aspx">String.Format</a> method (and wrappers for it, like <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.string.format.aspx">Console.Write</a>).</p>

<p><a href="http://tech.tulentsev.com/images/uploads/2009/01/image.png"><img src="http://tech.tulentsev.com/images/uploads/2009/01/image-thumb.png" alt="image" /></a></p>

<p>This is not very reliable method. You can forget to include parameter into the format string or confuse one parameter with another. And your IDE does not offer any help here.</p>

<h3>We want better way!</h3>

<p>People feel that this is not right and try to invent some more convenient methods. One of which is formatting with named parameters (using names instead of ordinals). Yesterday I read <a href="http://haacked.com/archive/2009/01/04/fun-with-named-formats-string-parsing-and-edge-cases.aspx">this blog post</a>. There are several implementations of formatting with named parameters and author makes more reliable and efficient implementation just for fun. But you know what? It still doesn&#8217;t seem right.</p>

<p><a href="http://tech.tulentsev.com/images/uploads/2009/01/image1.png"><img src="http://tech.tulentsev.com/images/uploads/2009/01/image-thumb1.png" alt="image" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb397696.aspx">Anonymous type</a> here is supposed to protect us from renaming issue, but it clutters the code. And again, we do not get any help from IDE (warnings about non-existing elements, highlighting, etc).</p>

<h3>But how can it be done even better?</h3>

<p>Let&#8217;s look at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nemerle">Nemerle</a>. It borrows &#8220;spliced string&#8221; syntax from languages like PHP (&#8220;hello, $username&#8221;). But it has several advantages over PHP and Perl. All expressions are resolved and typed at compile-time. And if you use <a href="http://nemerle.org/Download">VS package</a>, then you&#8217;ll get development-time checks (on-the-fly) and highlighting.</p>

<p>One picture is worth a thousand words. So look at these code samples</p>

<p><a href="http://tech.tulentsev.com/images/uploads/2009/01/image2.png"><img src="http://tech.tulentsev.com/images/uploads/2009/01/image-thumb2.png" alt="image" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://tech.tulentsev.com/images/uploads/2009/01/image3.png"><img src="http://tech.tulentsev.com/images/uploads/2009/01/image-thumb3.png" alt="image" /></a></p>

<p>Feel the difference! What can possibly go wrong here (except for <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.nullreferenceexception.aspx">NullReferenceException</a>, but <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.string.format.aspx">string.Format</a> is also vulnerable to it). Also, this code is very efficient. Essentially it is transformed to a series of <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.string.concat.aspx">string.Concat</a> or <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.text.stringbuilder.append.aspx">StringBuilder.Append</a> calls.</p>

<p>P.S.: One more thousand-words-picture.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I want to say again that decision to make identifiers case-insensitive is one of the worst design decisions a language author can make. Along with that goes &#8220;declare on first usage&#8221; decision, but more on this later.</p>

<p>Why is it bad? Because you either have to have proper development tools that support this decision, or assume high professionalism of the developers, letting them use conventional tools. Good professional developer will be consistent with casing of identifiers, because he sticks to some naming convention and case means something there (this is wild assumption, but I believe it is true, hehe).</p>

<p>Recently I had to fix some ancient program. It is written in Turbo Pascal 5. The IDE is even more useless than even Windows Notepad (can you imagine this?), that&#8217;s why I used <a href="http://notepad-plus.sourceforge.net/uk/about.php">Notepad++</a> to edit sources and launch compilation script.</p>

<p>In some recent versions it acquired so-called &#8220;smart highting&#8221;. This feature highlights all occurrences of a word when you select one of them. Very handy. BUT! it is case sensitive.</p>

<p><a href="http://tech.tulentsev.com/images/uploads/2008/12/image3.png"><img src="http://tech.tulentsev.com/images/uploads/2008/12/image-thumb3.png" alt="image" /></a></p>

<p>Take a look at the screenshot. You can see two occurrences of <em>valor</em> highlighted with green color, but another occurrence is not highlighted, it has different casing. This makes analysis of this source code somewhat harder.</p>

<p>Well, we could blame two sides here: lack of &#8220;case sensitivity&#8221; options for Notepad++ and this design decision of Niklaus Wirth. I tend to do the latter :-)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Virtually in every project you have to do some UI mockups. I mean, if you have some methodology, you are a team and you are serious about your project.</p>

<p>In my past experience I have tried different ways of creating mockups:</p>

<ol>
<li>hand-drawn pictures;</li>
<li>hand-drawn pictures, photographed with digital camera and inserted into requirement doc;</li>
<li>Visio documents (duh!);</li>
<li>some actual code.</li>
</ol>


<p>While the last way serves some extra purposes (other than creating mockup itself), it takes a lot of time. And sometime you just need to share with others a picture you have in your head. Ways #1 and #2 serve very well, but have one <strong>major</strong> disadvantage: if you want to modify a picture, you have to redraw it from scratch (or make a mess from the original one). And yeah, Visio way does more harm than good: it takes enormous time to create a picture and then you often &#8220;forget&#8221; to update a mockup, because you don&#8217;t want to launch that app again.</p>

<p>So, what options do we have?</p>

<p>Recently I discovered an excellent piece of software, called Balsamiq Mockups. It is simple, effective and nice looking. It requires zero learning time. For example, I tried to create something for my personal project, yet another photo gallery. And I got this mockup ready in exactly 6 minutes after I started the demo:</p>

<p><a href="http://tech.tulentsev.com/images/uploads/2009/01/image5.png"><img src="http://tech.tulentsev.com/images/uploads/2009/01/image-thumb5.png" alt="image" /></a></p>

<p>Impressions: product - great, support - fast and fully satisfying, overall - have to get one.</p>

<p>Also I want to quote <a href="http://www.facebook.com/s.php?k=100000080&amp;id=1162968534">Charles William Stanton</a> here:</p>

<blockquote><p>Before, I was doing far too little GUI &#8220;prototyping&#8221; because either the results weren&#8217;t reusable or the effort took too long; now I fear I may be doing too much because it&#8217;s just that much fun.</p></blockquote>

<p>Go to the <a href="http://www.balsamiq.com/products/mockups">product web site</a> and see it for yourself.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today I had to fight one small, but highly annoying problem. It is related to Entity Framework and SQL Server connection string. When you create a .edmx file with your model, the wizard automatically inserts proper connection string to your app.config or web.config file. Well, it is not always correct string.</p>

<p>In my case, I have .edmx file in a class library and it worked fine when I was using it from WinForms application. But then I decided to put it on a web site. And it ceased to work. The only thing I could get from it was</p>

<p>SQL Server 2005 SQLExpress error: &#8230;provider: Named Pipes Provider, error 40 - Could not open connection to SQL Server</p>

<p>I tried many things, but in the end it turned to be some mistreatment of a connection string. Mine looks this way:</p>

<p><a href="http://tech.tulentsev.com/images/uploads/2008/12/image1.png"><img src="http://tech.tulentsev.com/images/uploads/2008/12/image-thumb1.png" alt="image" /></a></p>

<p>The problem goes away when I put a backslash instead of slash in &#8220;./SQLEXPRESS&#8221;. It looks pretty weird, because they always used forward slash in such autogenerated connection strings, didn&#8217;t they?</p>

<p>P.S.: Sorry about connection string being image here. :-)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Sometimes, you may get not-very-descriptive <em>System.Security.SecurityException</em>. Stack trace tells you that something bad happened somewhere inside <em>EndGetResponse</em>, and that&#8217;s it, no more details. One possible cause is this: in a Silverlight project you may tell it to generate a temporary page that will host your application.</p>

<p><a href="http://tech.tulentsev.com/images/uploads/2008/11/image.png"><img src="http://tech.tulentsev.com/images/uploads/2008/11/image-thumb.png" alt="image" /></a></p>

<p>And if your application sends requests to some host (a linux virtual box, in my case), this will be the source of pain. The dynamically generated page gets loaded to Internet Explorer as <a href="file://your_path/TestPage.html">file://your_path/TestPage.html</a>. And you are trying to reach HTTP(S) host. This cross-scheme behavior is not allowed.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am trying to make a small Silverlight control that talks to PHP server. Sometimes problems arise and I have to deal with them myself, since there&#8217;s not much information on this topic in the internet. Trouble of the day is:</p>

<p><strong>The remote server returned an error: NotFound</strong></p>

<p>when trying to make simple POST request to a PHP page. I&#8217;ve spent half a day diagnosing this problem. And solution was found entirely by chance, because exception messages weren&#8217;t helping in any way. I mean, I was always getting abovementioned error message, without any details (what host, what page, request parameters, etc). But enough of complaints, let&#8217;s proceed to the solution. The troublesome code was this one:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='php'><span class='line'><span class="x">var _request = (HttpWebRequest)WebRequest.Create(_svcUri);</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">_request.Method = &quot;POST&quot;;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">_request.ContentType = &quot;application/json&quot;;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">_request.Headers[&quot;sid&quot;] = SessionID ; // &lt;==== this line</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>SessionID was null at the moment and this made HttpWebRequest so pissed off that it even wouldn&#8217;t send request header to the server ! And because of this, Fiddler was completely useless here. After adding necessary check, everything started working like a charm.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I installed this copy of Wordpress this evening and decided to add to Live Writer. But I&#8217;ve ran into problem almost immediately. While trying to auto-detect my editing style, blog name and who knows what else, Live Writer kept annoying me with this message: &#8221;<strong>Invalid Server Response - The response to the blogger.getUsersBlogs method received from the weblog server was invalid</strong>&#8221;.</p>

<p>I hit Ctrl-Ctrl (very handy shortcut of Google Desktop, that summons search bar) and pasted the error text there. First, I came across <a href="http://kannan.jumbledthoughts.com/index.php/windows-live-writer-problems-with-wordpress-how-to-fix/">this article</a>. I followed every step in it (some of them twice :-) ), but it didn&#8217;t help. So I kept searching.</p>

<p>Then I found <a href="http://wlwplugins.com/how-to-fix-invalid-bloggergetusersblogs-method-response.php">this interesting site</a>. Performing this step didn&#8217;t help me either. I have installed <a href="http://www.fiddlertool.com/fiddler/">Fiddler</a> and it finally shed some light on the problem. There was an error while requesting xmlrpc.php (which is used by external systems, such as WLW, to talk to Wordpress).</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Warning</strong>: include_once(/home/tulentse/public_html/blog_technical/wp-includes/class-IXR.php) [function.include-once]: failed to open stream: No such file or directory in <strong>/home/tulentse/public_html/blog_technical/xmlrpc.php</strong> on line <strong>55</strong>      <br/>

<strong>Fatal error</strong>: Class &#8216;IXR_Server&#8217; not found in <strong>/home/tulentse/public_html/blog_technical/xmlrpc.php</strong> on line <strong>108</strong></p></blockquote>

<p>I navigated to that file and saw that the name is in lower case (and case matters on Unix-based systems). It was joint effort of me, who checked &#8220;Convert filenames to lower case&#8221; option and Total Commander who did what I told him.</p>

<p>Now everyone&#8217;s happy :-)</p>

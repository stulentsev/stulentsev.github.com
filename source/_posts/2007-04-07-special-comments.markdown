Yesterday night I had a dream about how it would be cool to highlight special kinds of comments, like TODOs and BUGs.
But when I came to office, it turned out that JetBrains stole this idea a few days before. :-)
Their solution is extensible and customizable, but all those customizations don't work at the moment.
Mine, at the moment, has three hardcoded colors and regexes, and it IS working properly. :-)
Check it out:

This is done as a part of [Nemerle->VS2005 integration project](http://rsdn.ru/article/nemerle/Nemerle.VsIntegration-en.xml). [Here](http://rsdn.ru/article/nemerle/Nemerle.VsIntegration-ru.xml) is the link for russian readers.

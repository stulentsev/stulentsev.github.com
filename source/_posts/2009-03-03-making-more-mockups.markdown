Today Elen, my manager, approached me and asked to make a prototype of a new functionality in our project management system. This is a reimbursement management module: employees spend some money (taxi from airport, for example), then they create requests for reimbursements and if they are lucky and management approves the requests, they get the money back :-)

So, prototype it is. I fired up my [Balsamiq for Desktop ](http://balsamiq.com/products/mockups/desktop)and in under ten minutes mockups of two pages were ready. This is one of them:

But when I sent them to Elen, I thought that maybe she meant some real code, or HTML stubs in real system, because there was a mockup attached to her original email. Here it is:

And it took her approximately 30 minutes to make this one, because she had to printscreen some real pages and cut pieces from them. What a tedious work! :-) And it must be a hell to modify such mockup!




When I told her about [Balsamiq Mockups](http://balsamiq.com/), she became very interested and decided to give it a try. Another happy story. Thank you, Peldi :-)

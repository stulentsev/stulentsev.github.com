I remember reading my first book on Javascript. It was covering Javascript 1.0 and included
changes in Javascript 1.1 I thought then: "Wow, that's an advanced stuff!" If I was told 
that things like jQuery or Node.js will someday exist, I wouldn't believe that. And if 
tomorrow I fall into a time vortex and travel to 90s, I will probably kill myself. It's like
the stone age of technology. It's better to get to a real stone age. At least, the 
air is still clean. :)

Just a couple of days ago I blogged about [Dash](http://kapeli.com/dash). And now they have released new major version, with (at least one) new feature: cheatsheets. One of the things I just can't hold in my memory is HTTP status codes. I know 200 and 404, that's it. All others I have to look up, every single time. And Dash has a cheatsheet for this, so I am covered here.

There is no cheatsheet for Vim, not even on its movements. But good news is: you can create your own: [cheatset](https://github.com/Kapeli/cheatset#readme).

I shall probably create one for TextMate key shortcuts (I should know most of them by now, I guess). We'll see.

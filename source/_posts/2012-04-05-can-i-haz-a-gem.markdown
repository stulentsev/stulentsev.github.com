Back when I was just starting to program, we used to joke about Delphi coders.

> A Delphi coder wants to build a tool for cheating in games (read/write memory of another process). So, before writing a single line of code he goes to a forum and asks: "Are there ready-made components for building game cheating tools?"

I guess, this happens to every widely adopted technology that has plugins/libraries. [An example](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10022215/building-an-auction-with-ruby-on-rails).

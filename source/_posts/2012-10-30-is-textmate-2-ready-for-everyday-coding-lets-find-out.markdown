Oh, the TextMate 2 we all waited for so long. Okay, I wasn't really waiting, 
but I kept hearing about it. Never got to install the app.

So, tonight I wasn't able to fall asleep. I opened my macbook and started reading
news. One thing led to another and the next thing I know, I'm installing alpha
version of TextMate and a bundle for Go. Really, [Go](http://golang.org)? I hope
I won't be too surprised tomorrow :)

Okay, what's new?

* If you open a file with unknown extension, TextMate will offer to install a 
    bundle for it, if there's one.
* "Right margin" is now called "View -> Show Wrap Column"
* You can specify a default language for new files. 90% of my new files are Ruby 
    scripts, so it is a timesaver for me.
* New file browser. I'm not sure if I like it better or not.
* When you click on items in the file browser, they don't open automatically. You have to double-click.
* Awesome new app icon! :)



I will update this post when I find something new.

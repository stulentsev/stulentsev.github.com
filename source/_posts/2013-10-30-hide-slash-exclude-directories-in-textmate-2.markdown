I decided to give TextMate 2 another try today. Hopefully it won't freeze upon trying to install a bundle like it did last time. Now I don't recall which bundle was that, but so far things are going well. Mostly.

When I opened my Rails app and tried to navigate to file (`Cmd+T`), I saw this:

{% img center /images/uploads/2013/10/30/tm2_tmp_files.png %}

At first I thought that these are files from `.git` folder and spent embarrassing amount of time trying to make TM2 hide that folder. But these are actually temp asset files generated by Sprockets and they reside in `tmp/assets/...`.

Long story short, here's how you can hide a directory in TextMate 2, both from project browser and navigation dialog.

Create a `.tm_properties` file. It can be in current project dir or any parent dir (up to `$HOME`). Put this line into it.

```
excludeDirectories = "{tmp,}"
```

It is worth noting that `"{tmp}"` doesn't work. Apparently, TextMate glob parser breaks down if it can't find a comma. So we add one. Alternatively we can use this line:

```
excludeDirectories = "{$excludeDirectories,tmp}"
```

It will amend an existing `excludeDirectories` setting (empty string by default) instead of replacing. And it also has a comma. :)

Hope this post saved you some time.

I'm into running lately. So quite often I do these calculations in my head "if I ran 10 secs/km faster, what distance would I have covered?" As the calculation are quite difficult and I am quite lazy, here's a calculator that answers most of my questions. Posting it here for personal use, but maybe it'll be useful to someone else too.

Today I was looking at exception stack trace. One of suspicious places was '...\reports_controller.rb:129". Okay, navigating to this location using RubyMine is a piece of cake. Ctrl+Shift+N to get to reports_controller.rb, then Ctrl+G to position caret at specified line. But hey, that's two actions. I hit Ctrl+Shift+N, put 'reports_controller.rb:129' in and voila! It worked just as I expected!
RubyMine: +1 to intuitivity, +1 to overall impression.
